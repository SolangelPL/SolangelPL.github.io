My name is Solangel Lagares. I decided to study Software Engineering after many failed attempts to find where I belong. I have worked many jobs that did not make me feel happy. I always felt like I can do more. I was laid off from one of my jobs when I was five months pregnant at the time. Since then I have been a stay at home Mom and now I have 3 beautiful children. As they are getting older I am ready to start a Career. I feel like I have no more time to waste and I am in need to be at the next level in life.  I have always been computer savvy and determined to learn something new. This is when I discovered to persue a Career in Software Engineering. I know it will be a challenge, but I am ready for what is to come.
